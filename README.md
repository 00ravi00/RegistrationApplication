# RegistrationApplication
I have linked 3 external jar files which are requied to download from oracle website(I'll mention then below where i used them).
Before using this application create a database using MySQl and table with the columns that
i used in code and also change the user and password(in this programme i used database named ravi and table named userdata).

I have used javax.swing.* and java.awt.* libraries to create gui.
And used jdbc  driver to link to MySQL database(which  we have to create and change some parts of the code before using on different machine 
as MySQL uses to store seperatly rather than storing application). And we need to download .jar file(Driver) for connecting MySQL database 
and add it classpath.

and it also send user entered data to their mail.
